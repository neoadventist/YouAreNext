# This file maps Internet media types to unique file extension(s).
# Although created for httpd, this file is used by many software systems
# and has been placed in the public domain for unlimited redisribution.
#
# The table below contains both registered and (common) unregistered types.
# A type that has no unique extension can be ignored -- they are listed
# here to guide configurations toward known types and to make it easier to
# identify "new" types.  File extensions are also commonly used to indicate
# content languages and encodings, so choose them carefully.
#
# Internet media types should be registered as described in RFC 4288.
# The registry is at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/>.
