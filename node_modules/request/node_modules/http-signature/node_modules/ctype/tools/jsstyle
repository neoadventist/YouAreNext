# jsstyle - check for some common stylistic errors.
#
#	jsstyle is a sort of "lint" for Javascript coding style.  This tool is
#	derived from the cstyle tool, used to check for the style used in the
#	Solaris kernel, sometimes known as "Bill Joy Normal Form".
#
#	There's a lot this can't check for, like proper indentation of code
#	blocks.  There's also a lot more this could check for.
#
#	A note to the non perl literate:
#
#		perl regular expressions are pretty much like egrep
#		regular expressions, with the following special symbols
#
#		\s	any space character
#		\S	any non-space character
#		\w	any "word" character [a-zA-Z0-9_]
#		\W	any non-word character
#		\d	a digit [0-9]
#		\D	a non-digit
#		\b	word boundary (between \w and \W)
#		\B	non-word boundary
#
